# cambridge-modpack
Repository for custom modes in [Cambridge](https://github.com/MillaBasset/cambridge).

## How to use
Download the source code ZIP from [here](https://github.com/MillaBasset/cambridge-modpack/archive/main.zip).

Once done, extract the `tetris` and `res` folder into one of these directories, depending on how you're running Cambridge
(create any folders that don't exist!):  

* If you're running the game through a .exe, extract them into `%APPDATA%\cambridge\`.
* If you're running the game through a .love on Windows, extract them into `%APPDATA%\LOVE\cambridge\`.
* If you're running the game on Mac, extract them into `/Users/user/Library/Application Support/LOVE/cambridge/`.
* If you're running the game on Linux, extract them into `~/.local/share/love/cambridge/`.
* If you're running the game from the source code, extract them into the folder you installed Cambridge to.

Also, we have a `skins` folder. Click it to read instructions.
