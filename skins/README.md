# Skins for Cambridge

This folder contains various skins for Cambridge.

Refer to [this](../README.md) for your save directory.

## For Cambridge `0.4` and up (resource pack system)

To use a skin, download that skin's `zip` file, start Cambridge, drag it from your file explorer, and drop it onto the game window. Then, click the `Res. Packs` button on the pop-up.

If that doesn't work, copy the skin's `zip` file to:

    <save directory>/resourcepacks/

## For Cambridge `0.3`

To use a skin, download that skin's `zip` file, extract it somewhere, enter the `img` folder of the desired skin, and copy the images inside to:

    <save directory>/res/img/

That's it!
